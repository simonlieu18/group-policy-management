<p>
On the data center virtual machine created previously, in the Group Policy Management application locate "Group Policy Objects" and add a new policy called "Account Lockout Policy" or if there already is a policy linked to the domain then just skip this step.

Edit the policy, navigate to "Account Lockout Policy" and configure the policy as needed.

<p>
Link the organizational unit/domain to the new policy that was created unless the policy was already connected.

<p>
Now on the client virtual machine, manually update the Group Policy by opening Powershell and inputting the command "gpudate /force". Then run the command "rsop.msc" to verify that the policy has been applied.
